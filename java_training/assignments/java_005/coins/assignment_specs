Extra work (Java 005) - Optional

Create a class which can use the enumeration as a means of creating calculations.

Create an enumeration of US Dollar Coins

penny
nickel
dime
quarter
half dollar
dollar

So, you would have a class to handle the overall "Money Object"

Money.setPenny()
Money.setNickel()
...

Note: internally, this class handles the enum.

Another class to handle the enumeration

For example

CountMoney cm = new CountMoney(); <-- this class knows how to deal with output and potential gotchas and errors

And your Money object could be passed into your cm.setMoney(money)

So, set you want something like this:

money = Money.setPenny(2);
money = Money.setNickel(2);
money = Money.setDime(2);
money = Money.setDollar(2)

cm.setMoney(money)

The return would be:

cm.returnRaw() > 2.32
cm.returnPretty() > "2 dollars and 32 cents"
cm.returnCurrenty() > $.2.32

cm.setMoney() <-- no parameters returns

cm.returnRaw() > 0
cm.returnPretty() > "no money has been set"
cm.returnCurrency > "no money has been set"


Use custom exception handlers to ensure you have the correct 'error' handling

Encapsulate in the class the ability to ensure we can short form the enumeration (? static import)
